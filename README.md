# NopCommerce

nopCommerce is an open-source E-commerce solution based on ASP.NET MVC 4.0 and MS SQL Server 2008 backend Database.

nopCommerce permits us to make various stores that run utilizing a solitary back-end framework and can be overseen through a solitary administrator window. Since the back-end database for every one of the stores is the same, the index information, special data and item characteristics can be shared between stores, which is an extraordinary advantage when you are facilitating both B2B and B2C stores. It is conceivable to set separate designs for each store. The multi-store support is a helpful component for B2B advertisers who can rapidly set up smaller scale destinations for special items and crusades and connection it to the primary store.
